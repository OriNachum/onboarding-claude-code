# Sub Agents

[← Back to Automating Your Workflows](automating-your-workflows.md)

Sub Agents are specialized AI assistants that handle specific types of tasks. Each runs in its own context window with a custom system prompt, specific tool access, and independent permissions. They are your primary tool for **delegating self-contained tasks to focused specialists**.

## When to Use Sub Agents

Think "sub agents" when you catch yourself saying:

- "I want a code reviewer that can only read files, not edit them"
- "I need to run tests in isolation without cluttering my conversation"
- "I want to research three modules in parallel"
- "I need a data analysis agent that uses a faster, cheaper model"
- "I want an agent that remembers patterns it learns across sessions"

Sub agents are about delegation — handing off a complete task to a specialist that works independently and returns results.

## Key Concepts

**Isolation** — Each sub agent gets its own context window. Verbose output (test results, large file contents) stays in the sub agent's context, and only a summary returns to your main conversation.

**Tool restrictions** — You control which tools a sub agent can use. A code reviewer might only get `Read`, `Grep`, and `Glob`. A debugger might get `Read`, `Edit`, and `Bash`.

**Model selection** — Sub agents can use different models. Use `haiku` for fast, cheap exploration. Use `sonnet` for balanced work. Use `opus` for complex reasoning. Use `inherit` (default) to match the main conversation.

**Permission modes** — Sub agents can have their own permission mode: `default`, `acceptEdits`, `dontAsk`, `bypassPermissions`, or `plan`.

**Persistent memory** — Sub agents can maintain a memory directory that survives across sessions, building up knowledge over time.

## Getting Started: Your First Sub Agent

### Using the /agents command (recommended)

1. Run `/agents` in Claude Code
2. Select **Create new agent**
3. Choose **User-level** (available in all projects) or **Project-level** (this project only)
4. Select **Generate with Claude** and describe what you want
5. Configure tools, model, and color
6. Save — it's available immediately

### Writing a file manually

Create `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality, security, and best practices. Use after writing or modifying code.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: sonnet
---

You are a senior code reviewer. When invoked:

1. Run `git diff` to see recent changes
2. Focus on modified files
3. Check for: readability, error handling, security, test coverage, performance

Provide feedback organized by priority:
- **Critical** (must fix)
- **Warnings** (should fix)
- **Suggestions** (nice to have)
```

### Using it

Claude will automatically delegate when appropriate, or you can be explicit:

```
Use the code-reviewer agent to review my recent changes
```

## Common Patterns

### Read-only explorer

```markdown
---
name: explorer
description: Explores and analyzes codebases without making changes
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
model: haiku
permissionMode: plan
---

You are a codebase explorer. Search, read, and analyze code.
Summarize your findings with specific file references.
Never suggest changes — only report what you find.
```

### Debugger with edit access

```markdown
---
name: debugger
description: Debugging specialist for errors, test failures, and unexpected behavior
tools: Read, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
---

You are an expert debugger. When invoked:
1. Capture the error message and stack trace
2. Identify reproduction steps
3. Isolate the failure location
4. Implement a minimal fix
5. Verify the solution works
```

### Database query agent with hook validation

```markdown
---
name: db-reader
description: Execute read-only database queries for analysis
tools: Bash
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/validate-readonly-query.sh"
---

You are a database analyst with read-only access.
Execute SELECT queries to answer questions about data.
You cannot INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or modify schema.
```

### Agent with persistent memory

```markdown
---
name: pattern-learner
description: Reviews code and remembers patterns across sessions
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
memory: user
---

You are a code pattern analyst. As you review code:
- Check your memory for patterns you've seen before
- Update your memory with new patterns, conventions, and recurring issues
- Build institutional knowledge across sessions
```

## Where Sub Agents Live

| Location | Scope | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| `--agents` CLI flag | Current session only | 1 (highest) |
| `.claude/agents/` | Current project | 2 |
| `~/.claude/agents/` | All your projects | 3 |
| Plugin `agents/` directory | Where plugin is enabled | 4 (lowest) |

Higher-priority locations win when names conflict.

## Foreground vs Background

Sub agents can run in the foreground (blocking) or background (concurrent):

- **Foreground**: Blocks your conversation until complete. Permission prompts pass through to you.
- **Background**: Runs concurrently. Permissions are pre-approved before launch. Press `Ctrl+B` to background a running task.

Claude decides automatically, or you can ask: "run this in the background."

## Sub Agents vs Skills

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Reusable prompt that runs in your conversation | Skill |
| Isolated task with its own context and tools | Sub Agent |
| Read-only exploration that doesn't clutter your context | Sub Agent |
| Coding conventions Claude should always follow | Skill |
| Parallel research across multiple areas | Sub Agent |
| Step-by-step deployment playbook | Skill (or Skill with `context: fork`) |
