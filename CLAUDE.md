# CLAUDE.md — Agent Instructions

This file tells Claude Code (and other AI agents) how to work with this repository.

---

## What This Repo Is

A Claude Code guide, packaged as a plugin. There are two skills:

- **`/guide:onboarding`** — Interactive getting-started walkthrough for new users
- **`/guide:ask`** — Q&A skill backed by comprehensive reference documentation in `skills/guide/ask/references/`

This repo serves two audiences: humans browsing the docs on GitHub, and Claude Code users who install it as a plugin to get guided help.

This is a **content-only** repo — no application code, no build system, no tests.

## Critical Rules for Content

These rules MUST be followed when editing or creating skills:

1. **Slash commands are a subset of Skills** — never list them as a separate category. They are the same mechanism.

2. **Three automation mechanisms only**: Hooks, Skills, Sub Agents. Agent Teams are NOT a fourth mechanism — they are architecturally distinct (separate full Claude instances) and always flagged as experimental.

3. **Worktrees are an isolation layer**, not a coordination mechanism. They provide git-level isolation for parallel work.

4. **Agent Teams are experimental** — always flag them with ⚠️ and note they may change.

5. **The onboarding skill is interactive**, not a reference dump. It walks users through setup step by step. The ask skill answers questions by reading reference docs.

6. **IKEA analogy**: Hooks = assembly events (they fire during the process), Skills = packages with instruction sheets (reusable, pre-written), Sub Agents = packages + a handyperson (delegate and they deliver).

## How to Edit

- The onboarding skill lives at `skills/guide/onboarding/SKILL.md`
- The ask/Q&A skill lives at `skills/guide/ask/SKILL.md`
- Reference docs live at `skills/guide/ask/references/` — one file per topic
- The plugin manifest is at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (plugin name: `guide`)
- README.md is the human-facing entry point
- This file (CLAUDE.md) provides agent context — update the structure tree when adding/removing references
