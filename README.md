/plugin install guide@claude-code-guide
```

Or from the CLI:

### Usage

Once installed, two skills are available:

- **`/guide:onboard`** — Interactive getting-started walkthrough. Guides you through environment setup, your first session, and best practices.
- **`/guide:ask`** — Ask any question about Claude Code features. Reads relevant reference docs to give accurate, detailed answers.
