# Visualize Skills

Generate an interactive HTML dashboard of all installed
Claude Code skills and MCP servers, with scope/type filters.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Discover and parse data sources

#### Step 1a — Global skills (existing)

Read every `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` file.
For each one, extract:

- **name**: from YAML frontmatter `name` field;
  fall back to the directory name
- **description**: from YAML frontmatter `description`
  field
- **license**: from YAML frontmatter `license` field
  (default `"—"`)
- **has_scripts**: whether a `scripts/` subdirectory
  exists under that skill
- **body**: the markdown content after the frontmatter
  (everything below the closing `---`)
- **scope**: `"global"`
- **type**: `"skill"`

#### Step 1b — Project-level skills (new)

Read every `<CWD>/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` file.
Same parsing as Step 1a but tag with:

- **scope**: `"project"`
- **type**: `"skill"`

Skip silently if `<CWD>/.claude/skills/` does not exist.

#### Step 1c — Global MCP servers (new)

Read `~/.claude/settings.json` and look for the
`mcpServers` key. For each entry extract:

- **name**: the object key
- **command**: the `command` value
- **args**: the `args` array (join with spaces for
  display)
- **env**: the `env` object keys only (never expose
  values)
- **scope**: `"global"`
- **type**: `"mcp"`

Skip silently if the `mcpServers` key is missing or
the file doesn't exist.

#### Step 1d — Project-level MCP servers (new)

Read `<CWD>/.mcp.json` and look for the `mcpServers`
key. Same extraction as Step 1c but tag with:

- **scope**: `"project"`
- **type**: `"mcp"`

Skip silently if the file doesn't exist or the key
is missing.

#### Step 1e — Plugin-installed skills

Read `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`. For
each entry in `.plugins`, extract the first element's
`installPath`.

For each install path, read
`<installPath>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to get the
plugin `name`.

Then scan `<installPath>/skills/*/SKILL.md`. For each
skill found, extract the same fields as Step 1a, plus:

- **scope**: `"plugin"`
- **type**: `"skill"`
- **pluginName**: the plugin name from plugin.json

The slash-command for a plugin skill is
`/<pluginName>:<skillDirName>`.

Skip silently if `installed_plugins.json` does not
exist or if a plugin has no skills directory.

#### Step 1f — Game mode usage data

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.local/game-data.json`.

If the file exists and `enabled` is true, extract:

- **features**: the full features object (13 categories
  with count + lastUsed)
- **skillUsage**: the full skillUsage object (per-skill
  names with count + lastUsed)
- **sessionCount**: the session count

Embed as a JavaScript object in the `<script>` block:

- `const gameData = { features: {...},
  skillUsage: {...}, sessionCount: 0 };`

If the file does not exist or `enabled` is false:

- `const gameData = null;`

### Step 2 — Categorize skills

Use this exact mapping (applies to both global and
project skills):

| Category           | Color   | Skills                                |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Communication      | #10b981 | message-user, ask-slack, slack-bridge |
| DevOps & CI/CD     | #f97316 | automate, az-devops                   |
| Project Management | #3b82f6 | jira, confluence                      |
| Browser & Testing  | #a855f7 | playwright-mcp                        |
| Utilities          | #f59e0b | count-tokens, visualize-setup         |

Any skill not in the mapping goes into an **Other**
category with color `#6b7280`.

MCP servers are **not** categorized — they appear in
their own dedicated section.

### Step 3 — Generate HTML dashboard

Write a **single self-contained HTML file** to
`/tmp/claude-skills-dashboard.html`.

Embed the parsed data as two JavaScript arrays at the
top of a `<script>` block:

- `const skills = [...]` — each with: name,
  description, license, has_scripts, body, category,
  categoryColor, scope
- `const mcpServers = [...]` — each with: name,
  command, args, env, scope

The browser cannot read the filesystem, so all data
must be inlined.

#### Design spec

**Theme & layout:**

- Background: `#FFFAF5`
- Card background: `#FFFFFF`
- Card border: `1px solid #E5DDD4`
- Text: `#1A1A1A` (body), `#6B6560` (secondary)
- Header: large title with gradient text
  (`#D97706` to `#B45309`)
- Font: system-ui / -apple-system / sans-serif stack
- Max content width: `1200px`, centered

**Search bar:**

- Full-width input at the top, below the header
- Filters cards in real-time by name, description,
  or category
- Styled with warm input (`#FFF8F0` background),
  rounded corners, subtle border glow on focus

**Filter bar (between search bar and stats ribbon):**

- Two groups of pill toggle buttons in a horizontal
  row
- **Scope group:** `All` | `Global` | `Project` |
  `Plugin` — radio behavior (one active at a time)
- **Type group:** `All` | `Skills` | `MCPs` —
  radio behavior (one active at a time)
- Active pill: `#D97706` background, white text
- Inactive pill: `#F5EDE4` background, `#6B6560` text
- Rounded corners, smooth transitions
- Filters combine with search bar as AND conditions

**Stats ribbon (up to 8 stats):**

- A horizontal row of stat boxes below the filter bar:
  1. Total Skills — count of visible skills
  2. Categories — count of distinct categories among
     visible skills
  3. With Scripts — count of visible skills where
     `has_scripts` is true
  4. Licensed — count of visible skills where license
     is not `"—"`
  5. **MCP Servers** — count of visible MCP servers
  6. **Plugin Skills** — count of visible items with
     scope `"plugin"`
  7. **Sessions** — `gameData.sessionCount`, or `"—"`
     if gameData is null
  8. **Total Uses** — sum of all `skillUsage` counts
     from gameData, or `"—"` if gameData is null
- Stats 7-8 only render when gameData is not null
- Grid: `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(130px, 1fr))`
- Each stat box: subtle background (`#F5F0EB`), large
  number, small label below

**Category sections:**

- Each category gets a section with a colored
  left-border header bar
- Header shows category name + skill count badge
- Skills within the category are displayed as cards
  in a responsive grid
- Section is hidden when all cards within it are
  hidden by filters

**Skill cards:**

- Add `data-scope` and `data-type="skill"` attributes
  to each card element
- **Scope badge** in top-right corner:
  - Global: `#FFF7ED` bg, `#B45309` text
  - Project: `#F0FDF4` bg, `#15803D` text
  - Plugin: `#F5F3FF` bg, `#7C3AED` text
- Card shows:
  - Skill name (bold, `#2D2B27`)
  - Description (first 120 chars visible;
    "Show more" toggle if longer)
  - Capability tags extracted from the body (look for
    keywords: `curl`, `bash`, `MCP`, `webhook`,
    `REST API`, `jq`, `GitHub`, `Slack`, `browser`,
    `Playwright`; show matching ones as pill badges)
  - Quick command block: `/skill-name` displayed in a
    monospace code block with a copy-to-clipboard
    button
  - Footer: license badge + "has scripts" badge
    (if applicable)
  - **Belt badge** (if gameData is not null): a pill
    in the card footer showing the martial arts belt
    for this skill's usage count, plus "(N uses)" in
    secondary text. Usage lookup: for plugin skills
    use `skillUsage[pluginName + ":" + name]`, for
    others use `skillUsage[name]`; default to 0.

Belt thresholds (matching /guide:level-up):

| Count   | Belt   | Emoji | Color   |
|---------|--------|-------|---------|
| 0–15    | White  | ⚪    | #E5E7EB |
| 16–31   | Yellow | 🟡    | #FDE047 |
| 32–63   | Orange | 🟠    | #FB923C |
| 64–127  | Green  | 🟢    | #4ADE80 |
| 128–255 | Blue   | 🔵    | #60A5FA |
| 256–511 | Brown  | 🟤    | #A16207 |
| 512+    | Black  | ⚫    | #1F2937 |

Black Belt Dans: 1024 = 1st Dan ◻, 2048 = 2nd ◻◻,
4096 = 3rd ◻◻◻, 8192 = 4th ◻◻◻◻, 16384+ = 5th ◻◻◻◻◻.

Display: emoji + belt name as a pill badge, belt color
at 15% opacity background, full-opacity text. Omit
entirely if gameData is null.

- Hover: card lifts with `translateY(-4px)` and
  subtle shadow increase
- Transition: `all 0.2s ease`

**MCP Server section (below all skill categories):**

- Header: "MCP Servers" with `#D97706` left-border
  bar + count badge
- Same responsive grid as skill categories
- Section hidden entirely when zero MCP servers are
  visible
- **MCP card** shows:
  - Server name (bold, `#2D2B27`)
  - Scope badge in top-right corner (same colors as
    skill scope badges)
  - Type badge: "MCP" pill (`#92400E` bg,
    `#FFFFFF` text)
  - Command block: `command args...` in monospace
    with a copy-to-clipboard button
  - Env var keys as pill badges (keys only, never
    values — for security)
- Add `data-scope` and `data-type="mcp"` attributes
  to each MCP card
- Same hover/animation effects as skill cards

**Feature Mastery section (below MCP servers):**

Only rendered when `gameData` is not null. Hidden
entirely otherwise.

- Header: "🥋 Feature Mastery" with `#D97706`
  left-border bar
- Responsive grid of compact cards, one per feature:
  `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr))`
- Card style: smaller than skill cards, belt color as
  subtle left border (4px)

Each card shows:

- Feature display name (mapped from key):
  shell → "Shell", editing → "Editing",
  reading → "Reading", search → "Search",
  btw → "Quick Aside", skills → "Skills",
  plugins → "Plugins", web → "Web",
  planning → "Planning", notebooks → "Notebooks",
  agents → "Sub Agents", mcp → "MCP",
  loop → "Loop"
- Belt emoji + belt name
- Usage count + dan stripes if applicable
- Tier label: 🌱 Beginner, 🌿 Intermediate,
  🌳 Expert

Grouped by tier with small subheaders:

- **🌱 Beginner**: shell, editing, reading, search, btw
- **🌿 Intermediate**: skills, plugins, web, planning,
  notebooks, mcp, loop
- **🌳 Expert**: agents

**Animations:**

- Cards fade in with staggered delay on page load
  (CSS `@keyframes fadeInUp`)
- Each card's `animation-delay` = `index * 0.05s`

**Responsive:**

- Grid: `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(340px, 1fr))`
- Below 768px: single column, smaller padding
- Below 480px: further reduced font sizes

**No external dependencies** — all CSS and JS must be
inline in the HTML file.

#### JavaScript behavior

- `filterAll()` — combines search text + scope
  filter + type filter as AND conditions. Hides cards
  that don't match, hides category/MCP section headers
  when all their cards are hidden, and updates the
  stats ribbon
- Scope pill click: sets active scope, calls
  `filterAll()`
- Type pill click: sets active type, calls
  `filterAll()`
- Search input: calls `filterAll()` on each keystroke
- Copy button — writes text to clipboard, shows brief
  "Copied!" tooltip
- "Show more" / "Show less" — toggles full description
  visibility on skill cards
- Stats ribbon updates on every filter change (counts
  only visible items)
- `getBelt(count)` — returns `{ emoji, name, color,
  dans }` for a usage count using the belt threshold
  table
- `getSkillUsage(skill)` — looks up usage from
  `gameData.skillUsage` by matching
  `pluginName:name` or `name`; returns
  `{ count, lastUsed }` or defaults to 0
- `renderFeatureMastery()` — builds the Feature
  Mastery section from `gameData.features`
- `filterAll()` — updated to handle the "Plugin"
  scope filter and update Plugin Skills / Sessions /
  Total Uses stats

### Step 4 — Open in browser

```bash
open /tmp/claude-skills-dashboard.html
```

## Important notes

- Always re-scan skills and MCPs fresh each invocation
  (don't cache)
- Include `visualize-setup` itself in the dashboard
- The HTML must be fully self-contained with zero
  external requests
- Use semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<section>`,
  `<article>`, etc.)
- Skip missing files or keys silently — never error on
  absent project skills or MCP configs
