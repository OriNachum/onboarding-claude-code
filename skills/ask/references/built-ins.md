Claude Code ships with built-in slash commands, bundled skills, hook events, and built-in sub agents out of the box. This page is a reference for everything available without any custom configuration.

## 🌿 Bundled Skills

Bundled skills ship with Claude Code and are available in every session. Unlike slash commands which execute fixed logic, bundled skills are prompt-based playbooks that use Claude's tools.

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/simplify` | Reviews your recently changed files for code reuse, quality, and efficiency issues, then fixes them. Spawns three review agents in parallel. Run after implementing a feature or bug fix. |
| `/batch <instruction>` | Orchestrates large-scale changes across a codebase in parallel. Decomposes work into 5-30 independent units, spawns one agent per unit in isolated git worktrees, each opens a PR. Requires a git repo. |
| `/debug [description]` | Troubleshoots your current session by reading the session debug log. Optionally describe the issue to focus analysis. |

There is also a bundled **developer platform skill** that activates automatically when your code imports the Anthropic SDK — no manual invocation needed.

## 🌿 Built-in Hook Events

Claude Code provides these lifecycle events that you can hook into. No hooks are configured by default — you add them yourself — but these are the events available:

| Event | When it fires | Can block? |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | Session begins or resumes | No |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | User submits a prompt | Yes |
| `PreToolUse` | Before a tool call executes | Yes |
| `PermissionRequest` | Permission dialog appears | Yes |
| `PostToolUse` | After a tool call succeeds | No |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | After a tool call fails | No |
| `Notification` | Claude sends a notification | No |
| `SubagentStart` | A subagent is spawned | No |
| `SubagentStop` | A subagent finishes | Yes |
| `Stop` | Claude finishes responding | Yes |
| `TeammateIdle` | Agent team teammate goes idle | Yes |
| `TaskCompleted` | Task is marked as completed | Yes |
| `ConfigChange` | Configuration file changes | Yes (except policy) |
| `WorktreeCreate` | Worktree is being created | Yes |
| `WorktreeRemove` | Worktree is being removed | No |
| `PreCompact` | Before context compaction | No |
| `SessionEnd` | Session terminates | No |

Hook handlers can be shell commands (`type: "command"`), HTTP endpoints (`type: "http"`), LLM prompts (`type: "prompt"`), or agentic verifiers (`type: "agent"`).

See [Hooks](hooks.md) for how to get started, or the [official hooks reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks) for full schemas.

## 🌳 Built-in Sub Agents

Claude Code includes built-in sub agents that Claude automatically uses when appropriate:

| Agent | Model | Tools | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Explore** | Haiku (fast) | Read-only | File discovery, code search, codebase exploration. Claude delegates when it needs to search or understand a codebase without changes. |
| **Plan** | Inherits | Read-only | Codebase research for planning. Used during plan mode to gather context before presenting a plan. |
| **General-purpose** | Inherits | All tools | Complex research, multi-step operations, code modifications. Used when a task requires both exploration and action. |
| **Bash** | Inherits | Bash | Running terminal commands in a separate context. |
| **Claude Code Guide** | Haiku | Read-only | Answers questions about Claude Code features. |

These agents are used automatically. You don't need to configure them, but you can override them with custom agents of the same name, or disable them via permissions:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": ["Agent(Explore)", "Agent(Plan)"]
  }
}
```

See [Sub Agents](sub-agents.md) for how to create your own custom agents.

## Built-in Tools

Claude Code has access to these internal tools (used by both the main conversation and sub agents):

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Bash` | Execute shell commands |
| `Read` | Read file contents |
| `Write` | Create or overwrite a file |
| `Edit` | Replace a string in an existing file |
| `Glob` | Find files matching a pattern |
| `Grep` | Search file contents with regex |
| `WebFetch` | Fetch and process web content |
| `WebSearch` | Search the web |
| `Agent` | Spawn a sub agent |
| `Skill` | Invoke a skill |

MCP servers can add additional tools with the naming pattern `mcp__<server>__<tool>`.

## Quick Reference Shortcuts

| Prefix | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/` | Invoke a command or skill |
| `!` | Run a bash command directly (bash mode) |
| `@` | File path mention with autocomplete |
